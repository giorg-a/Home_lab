# Home Lab – Cybersecurity Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal cybersecurity home lab and hands-on learning process.

The goal of this lab is not to run tools blindly, but to understand **how attacks behave on the network** and how defenders detect and analyze them.

Each day focuses on a small, practical scenario and builds intuition step by step.

---

## What this lab focuses on
- Attacker behavior on the network
- Reconnaissance vs exploitation patterns
- Network traffic observation
- Defender (SOC) mindset
- Learning through practice and analysis

---

## Lab Environment
- Kali Linux – attacker machine
- Metasploitable2 – vulnerable target
- Security Onion – network sensor / SIEM

All machines are placed on an isolated internal network to safely observe traffic.
