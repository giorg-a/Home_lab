Day 2 — Loud vs Stealth Nmap Scan
Network Behavior Analysis
Goal

— Analyze and compare how loud and stealth-ier Nmap scans behave on a network
— Observe real differences using Wireshark, not just Nmap output

Lab Setup

— Attacker machine: Kali Linux
— Target machine: Metasploitable
— Traffic visualization: Wireshark

Loud Scan

— Generated an extremely large amount of traffic
— Normal background network activity was overwhelmed
— Around 133,000 packets captured in total
— Only about 1,300 packets represented successful connections (SYN-ACK)
— Very easy to detect due to high contrast with baseline traffic
— Provided a large amount of useful information about the target
— Difference is clearly visible in filtered vs unfiltered captures

Stealth Scan

— Generated significantly less traffic
— Packets were spread out over time
— Blended in with background traffic such as ARP, DNS, and SSDP
— Took approximately 1,652 seconds (~27 minutes) to complete
— Much harder to visually detect
— Provided less information compared to the loud scan

Key Takeaways

— Loud scans are fast, noisy, and information-rich, but very easy to detect
— Stealth scans are slow, quiet, and blend into normal network behavior
— Stealth does not mean invisible; it means lower contrast with baseline traffic
— Most scan traffic is noise, while only a small portion represents real exposure

Conclusion

— This lab demonstrated how loud and stealth Nmap scans actually look and behave on a real network
— All observations are supported by the included Wireshark screenshots
Conclusion

Today’s lab helped visualize and understand how loud and stealth Nmap scans actually behave on a real network, rather than just reading about them theoretically.
All observations are supported by the provided Wireshark screenshots, showing both filtered and unfiltered views of the traffic.
