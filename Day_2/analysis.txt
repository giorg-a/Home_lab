Day 2 – Loud vs Stealth Nmap Scan Behavior Analysis
Goal

The goal of Day 2 was to analyze and compare the network behavior of loud and stealth Nmap scans and understand how they appear from a network monitoring perspective.

Lab Setup

Attacker: Kali Linux

Target: Metasploitable

Analysis Tool: Wireshark (for traffic visualization)

Wireshark was used to observe packet volume, timing, and interaction with normal background network traffic.

Loud Scan Analysis

The first scan performed was a loud Nmap scan.

As expected, the scan was extremely noisy. It generated a massive amount of traffic that overwhelmed normal background network activity, making other processes almost invisible in the capture.

Total packets captured: ~133,000

Successful connections (SYN-ACK): ~1,300

This clearly shows that:

Most of the traffic generated by a loud scan is noise

Only a small fraction represents actual open services

Both unfiltered and filtered Wireshark views (using SYN-ACK filtering) clearly demonstrate this difference.
Despite being very loud, the scan provided a large amount of useful information about the target system, including exposed services and detailed responses.

Stealth Scan Analysis

The second scan performed was a stealth-ier Nmap scan.

As expected, this scan behaved very differently:

Traffic volume was much lower

Packets were spread out over time

The scan blended in with normal background traffic such as ARP, DNS, and SSDP

Visually, it was almost invisible compared to the loud scan

However, stealth scanning also comes with trade-offs.

Downsides observed:

Total scan time: 1,652 seconds (~27 minutes)

Much less information gathered compared to the loud scan

While the stealth scan preserved the core signal (open ports), it sacrificed speed and depth of information in exchange for lower visibility.

Key Takeaways

From this analysis, the following conclusions were made:

Loud scans are:

Fast

Very visible

Information-rich

Easy to detect due to high contrast with baseline traffic

Stealth scans are:

Slow

Quiet

Harder to distinguish from normal network behavior

More limited in the information they provide

This lab demonstrated that stealth does not mean invisible, but rather less noticeable by reducing contrast with normal traffic.

Conclusion

Today’s lab helped visualize and understand how loud and stealth Nmap scans actually behave on a real network, rather than just reading about them theoretically.
All observations are supported by the provided Wireshark screenshots, showing both filtered and unfiltered views of the traffic.
